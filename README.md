# GeneticsAlgorythm

## Wtf is this?!
It's mostly just a personal spin on a common Genetics Algorythm and experimenting with uses for it. This is very much a work in progress and meant more for learning and experimenting then practical application.

## Todo
* Speed things up
* Move all example code into js files, so index files are purely for bootstrapping
* More examples
* Rebuild in faster languages

# Examples

## Pathfinder
Using a Genetics Algorythm to find paths. Each link in the 'DNA' chain for this example is a direction (up, down, left, right) and fitness for a generation is based on the closest that generation gets to the goal, how often the generations steps walk over places they've already been, and how often they 'bump' into walls.

## Vectorizer
A collection of examples of using a Genetics Algorythm to vectorize existing images. Each link in the 'DNA' chain represents components used to draw simple shapes and the generation fitness is calculated by first drawing the entire generation and then comparing how close the result is from the target image.
